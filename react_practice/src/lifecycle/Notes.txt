Mounting :
----------
    Mounting is the phase in which our React componen mounts on the DOM. (is created and inserted into the DOM)
    This phase comes into the picture after initialization phase is completed.
    In this phase, our component will render first time.
    Avialble methods in this Phase :
           1. componentWillMount() :
           -------------------------
                    This method will be called, before a component mounts on the DOM or the render method is called.
                    After this method, component gets mounted.

                    Note: You should not make API calls or any data changes using this.setstate in this method because it is called before the render method. 
                          So, nothing can be done with the DOM (i.e. updating the data with API response) as it has not been mounted. Hence, we canâ€™t update the state with the API response.
                    

           2. componentDidMount() :
           ------------------------
                    This method is called after the component gets mounted on the DOM. Like componentWillMount, it is called once in a lifecycle. 
                    Before the execution of this method, the render method is called (i.e., we can access the DOM). We can make API calls and update the state with 
                    the API response.
                    If we have any changes in the state then, component will be rendered again. (Only once). If no changes in the state, then no render.

Updating :
----------
        After completion of Mouting phase, Updating phase comes into the picture.
        Here the component phase changes and re-render of the component happen.
        Avialble methods in this phase :

        1. shouldComponentUpdate() :
        ---------------------------
        2. componentWillUpdate() :
        ---------------------------
        3. componentDidUpdate() : 
        --------------------------

UnMounting :
------------
    1. componentWillUnmount()
